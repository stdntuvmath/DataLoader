# DataLoader

This program was made to pull price data into an sql database. It works in tandem with another program called LootLoader. The goal of Dataloader is to give LootLoader the data it needs to create price candlesticks for the purpose of evaluation and buying/selling stocks. Dataloader uses sql queires to insert data into the database. The data is confirmed on SQL Server Management Studio using a SELECT query.
